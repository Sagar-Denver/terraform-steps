1. Prepare Your Environment:
Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.
Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions for Terraform to interact with AWS services.

2. Create Terraform Configuration Files:
Create a directory for your Terraform configuration files (e.g., terraform/).
Inside the directory, create the following files:
main.tf: Main Terraform configuration file for defining AWS resources.
variables.tf: File for declaring variables used in the Terraform configuration.
outputs.tf: File for defining outputs to display after Terraform applies the configuration.

3. Define AWS ECS Resources:
In main.tf, define the AWS ECS resources required to deploy the Medusa application. This includes:
ECS Cluster: Define an ECS cluster where the containers will be deployed.
ECS Task Definition: Define a task definition for the Medusa application, specifying the Docker image, CPU/memory limits, container port, and any environment variables.
ECS Service: Define an ECS service to manage the deployment and scaling of the task(s) in the ECS cluster.

4. Set Up Networking and Load Balancing (Optional):
If needed, define networking resources such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to expose the Medusa application to the internet.
Configure the ALB to route traffic to the ECS service using target groups.

5. Configure Docker Image and Registry:
Ensure that the Docker image for the Medusa Node.js application is available in a Docker registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Docker Hub).
Provide the Docker image URI in the ECS task definition within the Terraform configuration.

6. Define Terraform Variables:
In variables.tf, define variables such as AWS region, ECS cluster name, Docker image URI, container port, CPU/memory limits, and any other configuration parameters.

7. Apply Terraform Configuration:
Run terraform init in the terminal to initialize the Terraform project.
Run terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform will apply.
Run terraform apply to apply the Terraform configuration and deploy the Medusa application in AWS ECS.

8. Verify Deployment:
After Terraform successfully deploys the resources, verify that the Medusa application is running in AWS ECS.
Access the application using the ALB URL or ECS service endpoint to ensure it is functioning as expected.

9.Clean Up (Optional):
To clean up resources created by Terraform, run terraform destroy after verifying the deployment. This will remove the ECS cluster, services, tasks, networking resources, and any other provisioned resources.
